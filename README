"gitserv" is a git server hosting program which includes a web
GUI built with Link and a modified version of soft serve, a 
ssh GUI for git.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

	Since this is a git-based program, you need git to be installed. 
	For compiling, install cmake, gcc, ninja, and go. The web front
	end uses Link, an http library in C++ built by N11.

COMPILING AND RUNNING GITSERV

	Run "cmake -GNinja ." in the project root. You may also use make
	as your build system but it isn't recommended and not tested. Then run "ninja"; it will build an executable named "gitserv" to which you can run with "./gitserv".
